# pi-opencode-free

Free OpenCode models in [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi), no API key.

## Why

The Pi CLI already ships an `opencode` provider, but through it the models only run on paid plans. This extension hits the same endpoint and removes the need for a paid plan: it discovers the models advertised as free and sends the OpenCode client headers (`x-opencode-client`, `x-opencode-project`, `User-Agent`) on every request, which authorizes free, keyless usage.

Everything else is Pi's native `openai-completions` engine: streaming, reasoning, tools. Nothing is intercepted or rewritten.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-opencode-free
```


## Usage

Pick any `(Free)` model in Pi's model selector. The free-model catalog is
managed natively by Pi: it loads instantly from a persisted snapshot and
refreshes itself in the background on interactive startup or when opening
the model selector.
